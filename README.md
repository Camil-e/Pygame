This is a basic jumper game that i coded as part of the practical side of my Computer Science A-Level
I followed The Ultimate Introduction to Pygam by Clear Code (https://youtu.be/AY9MnQ4x3zk?si=9z2ylqR28tEDMozB)

To run the file first have python intall and updated to the latest version and then install the pygame module by opening the windows terminal and using the command "pip install pygame"
Then dowload the graphics, font and code file and store then all the in same file 
The program should then run fine 
Make sure the file names are all the same in the code
